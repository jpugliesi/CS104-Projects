BEGIN SOLUTION
1. the empty string is correctly parenthesized
2. any single character is correctly parenthesized
3. if E is a correctly parenthesized expression, so is (E), the 
concatenation of an opening parenthesis, E, and a closing parenthesis.
4. if E is a correctly parenthesized expression, so is [E], the 
concatenation of an opening bracket, E, and a closing bracket.
5. if E1 and E2 are correctly parenthesized expressions, so it E1E2,
the concatenation of the two expressions.

Note that 1&2 could be combined into a single rule. Similarly, 3&4 can 
be easily combined.
